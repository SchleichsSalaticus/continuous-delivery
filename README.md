# Continuous delivery project

This project is used to store a docker container to upload new package updates
to [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org/).

It uses a predefined oscrc file which has to be hacked by environment variables
to update the user and password to give upload right to osc (OBS command line
tool).

## Disclaimer

In order to use this delivery process some conditions are required:

1. OBS project and package must already exist. The process won't create a package.
2. .spec and .changes file should be added to the git project. Otherwise current
.spec and .changes from the OBS package will be used, but this is not recommended
if you want a real CD pipeline.
3. Build process is not currently executed, so make sure the project builds
locally (this feature might be added in the future).
4. Package version will be obtained from "Version: " in the .spec file.

## How to use

These steps must be followed to run the delivery operation:

1. Pull the docker image. The image is currently stored in: https://cloud.docker.com/u/shap/repository/docker/shap/continuous_deliver

```bash
docker pull shap/continuous_deliver:latest
```

2. Set the environment variables. This is not mandatory but it will facilitate
things:

```bash
export OBS_USER=my-user # my obs user name
export OBS_PASS=my-pass # my obs user password
export OBS_PROJECT=my-project # obs project
export PACKAGE_NAME=my-package # package name in obs project
```

Here other optional parameters:

```bash
export FOLDER=/package # used folder inside the docker container where our code is located
export TARGET_PROJECT=target-project # target project to create a submit request
export TAR_NAME=my-tar # Custom tar name. Otherwise package name will be used
```

3. Run the docker container

```bash
docker run -t -v "$(pwd):/package" -e OBS_USER=$OBS_USER -e OBS_PASS=$OBS_PASS -e OBS_PROJECT=$OBS_PROJECT -e PACKAGE_NAME=$PACKAGE_NAME shap/continuous_deliver /bin/bash -c "cd /package;/upload.sh"
```

*FOLDER* variable must match with the path used in the volume creation and last
command execution


## Example

In [.travis.yml](.travis.yml.example) you can find an example travis file that
might be used to in your project.

For that, you must set your OBS user and password in the travis project settings.

## How to contribute

To contribute the project just update the project code and create a pull request.
After merging the code the new docker image will be created automatically.
